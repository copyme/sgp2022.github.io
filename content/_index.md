## Response to Pandemic

Due to the volatile development of the pandemic situation, it continues to be difficult to predict how the possibilities to travel will evolve during spring. In order to make your conference participation (and the organization) better projectable, we have now decided to run SGP 2022 as an online conference—just like last year. The submission and review process and the schedule are not affected by this decision. Paper presentations and invited talks will be held online and we’ll offer online networking opportunities to make the conference experience as interactive and social as possible.
