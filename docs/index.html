<p id=about>
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School on July 2nd and 3rd, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.

<h2 id="response-to-pandemic">Response to Pandemic</h2>
<p>Due to the volatile development of the pandemic situation, it continues to be difficult to predict how the possibilities to travel will evolve during spring. In order to make your conference participation (and the organization) better projectable, we have now decided to run SGP 2022 as an online conference—just like last year. The submission and review process and the schedule are not affected by this decision. Paper presentations and invited talks will be held online and we’ll offer online networking opportunities to make the conference experience as interactive and social as possible.</p>
